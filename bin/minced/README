MinCED - Mining CRISPRs in Environmental Datasets


MinCED is a program to find Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic
Repeats (CRISPRs) in full genomes or environmental datasets such as metagenomes,
in which sequence size can be anywhere from 100 to 800 bp. MinCED runs from the
command-line and was derived from CRT (http://www.room220.com/crt/):
  Charles Bland et al., CRISPR Recognition Tool (CRT): a tool for automatic
  detection of clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats, BMC
  Bioinformatics 8, no. 1 (2007): 209.


INSTALLATION

You need to install these dependencies first:
  * Java (http://www.java.com/en/download/)

there is a Makefile in the source directory so installation should be as simple as:

$ cd <download_folder>
$ make

To run MinCED:

$ ./minced [options] file.fa

The help page can be obtained by typing:
$ ./minced --help

You can get the MinCED version this way:
$ ./minced --version

NOTE: Always keep `minced` and `minced.jar` in the same folder!

EXAMPLES

Finding CRISPRs in the E. coli genome:
    $ minced ecoli.fna

To find repeats in short sequences, we need to decrease the minimum number of
repeats to find. For example, in 100 bp reads, we could not possibly find more
than 2 repeats:
    $ minced -minNR 2 metagenome.fna

The output can be large, so save it in a file:
    $ minced -minNR 2 metagenome.fna metagenome.crisprs
